A new gtk4 audio editor app about-to written with python, beautiful &amp; no-telemetry, maybe at 2023/24...

(update-2022/5/11 : asour old computer has no sound to my knowedge, I may go for an another gtk4 app to develop. I wonder if KWave gets a visual redesign before/after KDE 6, because that would be the best alternative for the time. Or eko, whick is an another sound editor tool?)
