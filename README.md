# claps
A new gtk4 audio editor about-to written with python, beautiful &amp; no-telemetry!

If I actually would start developing it, that would be nice!?
(GTK4 media player written in python, Clapper used Meson & its documentation has a page for gnome, so I will go with Meson!)
Anyway, there's some initial pictures from my design document...
